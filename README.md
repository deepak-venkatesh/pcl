# Practical Common Lisp – My Workthrough

This repo has my notes and code as I work through *Practical Common Lisp* by Peter Seibel.
The book has generously been made available freely by the author: https://gigamonkeys.com/book/

- `examples.lisp` → code I typed from the book with some experiements I tried
- `notes.md` → explanations or reminders for myself
- `exercises.lisp` → exercises I have made for myself and other learners

### Chapters I’ve covered:
- Chapter 01: Introduction: Why Lisp?
- Chapter 02: Lather, Rinse, Repeat: A Tour of the REPL
- Chapter 03: Practical: A Simple Database
- Chapter 04: Syntax and Semantics


### I am using the following
- SBCL
- Quicklisp
- Emacs
- SLIME
- On a Macbook
- I have also studied cover to cover the book *Common Lisp: A Gentle Introduction to Symbolic Computing* 2nd ed. by David Touretzky. I highly recommend this as the first book to learn Lisp, rather any programming language.
